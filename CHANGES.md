# Changes Made to Wireless Network Design Application

## Summary
Fixed critical issues in the AI-powered web application for wireless and mobile network design to ensure proper functionality across all four scenarios.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Parameter Mapping Issues
**Problem**: The `map_parameters()` function was incorrectly trying to map frontend parameters to backend parameters using a complex mapping dictionary, but the frontend was already sending parameters with the correct backend names.

**Solution**: Simplified the `map_parameters()` function to return the data as-is since no mapping was needed.

### 2. Request Data Structure Handling
**Problem**: The `handle_calculation()` function wasn't properly extracting parameters from the request structure sent by the frontend.

**Solution**: Modified the function to handle both direct parameter objects and nested parameter structures (`data['parameters']`).

### 3. API Endpoint Routing
**Problem**: The frontend was always calling the `/api/wireless-communication` endpoint regardless of the selected scenario.

**Solution**: Updated the frontend JavaScript to map each scenario to its correct API endpoint:
- `wireless-comm` → `/api/wireless-communication`
- `ofdm` → `/api/ofdm-systems`
- `link_budget` → `/api/link-budget`
- `cellular_design` → `/api/cellular-design`

### 4. Scenario Name Consistency
**Problem**: Validation and calculation functions were using inconsistent scenario names (`wireless_comm` vs `wireless-comm`).

**Solution**: Updated all functions to use consistent scenario names matching the frontend.

### 5. Response Format
**Problem**: The response was returning `results` but the frontend expected `calculations`.

**Solution**: Changed the response format to return `calculations` instead of `results`.

### 6. Input Validation
**Problem**: Missing parameter validation was causing unclear error messages.

**Solution**: Added proper null/undefined parameter checking with clear error messages.

## Files Modified

### Backend Files
- `backend/app.py`: Fixed parameter mapping, request handling, validation, and calculations
- `backend/templates/index.html`: Fixed API endpoint routing in JavaScript

### No Changes Required
- `backend/requirements.txt`: Dependencies were already correct
- `backend/static/script.js`: No separate script file existed
- Frontend parameter templates were already correct

## Testing Results

All four scenarios have been tested and are working correctly:

1. **Wireless Communication System**: ✅ Working
   - Calculates output rates for sampler, quantizer, source encoder, channel encoder, interleaver, and burst formatting
   
2. **OFDM Systems**: ✅ Working
   - Calculates resource element rate, OFDM symbol rate, resource block rate, max transmission capacity, and spectral efficiency
   
3. **Link Budget Calculation**: ✅ Working
   - Calculates FSPL, received power, noise power, and SNR
   
4. **Cellular System Design**: ✅ Working
   - Calculates total users, traffic, cell area, link margin, and required cells

## Deployment Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

## API Usage

Each scenario has its own endpoint that accepts POST requests with JSON data:

```json
{
  "scenario": "scenario_name",
  "parameters": {
    "param1": value1,
    "param2": value2,
    ...
  }
}
```

The response format is:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "calculations": {
    "result1": value1,
    "result2": value2,
    ...
  },
  "explanation": "AI-generated explanation (if available)"
}
```

## Notes

- AI explanations require OpenRouter API configuration via environment variables
- All calculations follow standard wireless communication formulas
- The application supports CORS for frontend-backend communication
- Input validation ensures all required parameters are provided and valid
